## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "Create a simple React app that:
> 
> Connects to MetaMask wallet.
> 
> Has a form/button to create an attendance session (calls a smart contract function createSession(string name)).
> 
> Allows the connected user to mark their attendance by calling markAttendance(uint256 sessionId) on the smart contract.
> 
> Has an input box and button to send a tip (ETH) to a predefined address using MetaMask.
> 
> Uses ethers.js for blockchain interaction.
> 
> Displays status messages for wallet connection, transactions, and errors.
> 
> Keep UI minimal with basic styling.
> 
> Assume the contract ABI and address are imported and available as variables."

### Code Generation Prompt

> Based on the content model I created for the above requirements, now build a complete web application that showcases this content. Include a modern, responsive design with proper navigation, content display, and user-friendly interface.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.
